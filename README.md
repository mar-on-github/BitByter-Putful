# BitByter Putful
 A virus thingy I made as a 13yo edgy programmer.
**DO NOT RUN PUTFUL BITBYTER WITH MALICIOUS OR ILLEGAL INTENT, I AS CREATOR DO NOT CONTROL WHAT THIS MIGHT DO, AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSILE FOR YOUR USAGE OF THIS CODE.**
## How I created this?
I believe the project I was working on was a drive compression program that allowed me to save up to 16 gb to a 800mb cd, and have it rewritable (flexing, flexing, but I stopped the project after I found out that there are limits to these techniques and lost interest). I needed a simple tool to fill up my drive, so I created this. But as expected, it ran out of RAM on my smoll Windows XP laptop.

... Which made me do a 360, remove the prior functional code, and aim it at crashing computers.

## So, what does it do?
The basis? Duplicating itself. In practise? Doing that more and more until the computer stops being able to handle that.
